TO DO LIST:

- implement message handling for the error controller
	if i write a weird url the error controller works, but there is also an error which sais that the file is not included in /libs/
- add constants to all paths in the system so that they can be changed at any time (models,controllers etc)
- add else branch in controller.php to account for not finding the file
- improove Hash.php
- session.php research wtf does @session_start() mean... what's that @

- create a custom header/footer loader! something like this
$this->view->render('error/index', 'error/include/header');

public function render($page, $header = 'header', $footer = 'footer');
